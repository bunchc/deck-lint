# Kong Deck File Linting Rules

This project contains sets of linting rules to be used with the `deck file lint` command. These rules provide a starting point to enforce various standards like tagging. Additionally, there are some rules defined to help alert for incompatiable changes between decK versions (`plugins/updated-plugins/updated-plugins-2.8-3.4.yaml`).
